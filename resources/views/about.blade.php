          <h3 class="mb-4">OUR STORY</h3>
          <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">Building Supply Bridge was a journey of growth and learning. We began with 
            little experience in web development, choosing Laravel as our framework of choice.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">The learning curve was steepâ€”setting up migrations, routes, and understanding controllers 
            felt overwhelming at times. Each error message became a lesson, and with every success, we grew more 
            confident. But our biggest challenge came when we struggled to find the right inspiration for our website. 
            After much brainstorming, we realized the purpose was simple: to bridge the gap between suppliers and 
            customers. With that vision, Supply Bridge was born, a platform focused on trust and convenience. Through
             persistence, we turned a dream into a reality, learning and evolving every step of the way.</p>
